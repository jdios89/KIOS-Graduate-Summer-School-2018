# Regression exercise

## Objectives
In this exercise you will be asked to predict the energy efficiency of buildings given various building parameters, such as, the surface area and height. You will become familiar with *pandas* (a powerful tool for data analysis) and *scikit-learn* (a popular machine learning library).

## Problem description
You will be asked to predict the heating load and cooling load of buildings given various building parameters. Specifically, the following information will be given for each building.

    X1 Relative Compactness
    X2 Surface Area
    X3 Wall Area
    X4 Roof Area
    X5 Overall Height
    X6 Orientation
    X7 Glazing Area
    X8 Glazing Area Distribution

    y1 Heating Load
    y2 Cooling Load
