## System identification module

Material for the system identification module of the workshop of the [KIOS Graduate Summer School 2018](http://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/summer-school/).

### Folder contents

1. [sysid_linsys_ls](./sysid_linsys_ls.ipynb): python notebook for linear system identification by regularized least squares
2. [sysid_rkhs](./sysid_rkhs.ipynb): python notebook for nonlinear system identification by kernel-based methods and description of the system identification task for the competition

### Summary

In this module we will go through some of the most popular system identification methodologies; we will start with start with identification methods for **linear** dynamical systems using **regularized least squares**. In particular, we will venture a detailed formulation of such least-squares problems and solve them using CVXPy - a popular tool for numerical optimization. 

The second part of this module will focus on the identification of **nonlinear** systems using the kernel trick. After a short introduction to **reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces** and the exposition of a few key theoretical results, we will use kernel-based methods to identify nonlinear systems. We will demonstrate how powerful these methods are by identifying a chaotic system from data.

### Competition

The workshop will be concluded by a competition which will feature three tasks, one for each module. For the system identification module, participants will identify an unknown nonlinear system using [input-output data](./data/README.md).
